// TODO: Development log   

[TODO]  
    # Components:
        @ DAEMON:
            - component_pool:
                    * Complete stop()
        @ MAIL:
            - files should be divided into server.py, mail.py and so on for structure.

        @ UTILITY:
            - received message should be considered into two parts:
                * One for IPC developer usage and the other one should be used
                for IPC user.
                * One considerable scheme might be ReceivedMessage for IPC class user
                and ReceivedStreamMessage and ReceivedBorderMessage for IPC developer. 

        @ OTHER:
            - These components remain to be implmeneted: 
                * Mail service
                * Log
                * Monitor
            - Deprecate the naming convention for pointer data member like pData.
            - Take Singleton pattern to replace the out-dated code. like: extern __, init__.

    # More TODOs can be seen in the navigator TODOs.    

    # More structured code needs to be occur in this project.

    # Replace the manual-test-unit with auto-test-unit.

[NOTE]
    # Review IO multiplexation: Understand the epoll more deeply.
